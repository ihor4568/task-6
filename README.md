# task 6

create markup (it should look like you want) using https://material.io/develop/web/

you should use these components:
 - Top App Bar
 - Drawer
 - Button
 - Select
 - Dialog
 - List
 - Menu
 - Card
 - Tab bar
 - also any components you want

(components demos are here https://material-components.github.io/material-components-web-catalog/#/)

this time you **SHOULD USE JS**, so these component would work

the directory structure of your components would look like:

```
components/
   <component name>/
      <component name>.scss
      <component name>.js  (if needed)

index.js
index.scss
```


please use webpack that you configured in the previous task

instead of hosting your page - just attach screenshot of your work to the pull request

please use latest standards of js (in places where you need it)

**DO NOT CREATE SEPARATE REPOSITORY** - just create a separate branch here, and a separate pull request


## deadline - Friday 23:59
